2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s0/i_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s0/i_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell s0/i_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s0/i_reg[1]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s0/i_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell s0/i_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s0/i_reg[2]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s0/i_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell s0/i_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s0/i_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s0/i_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell s0/i_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s0/seg_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s0/seg_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell s0/seg_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
