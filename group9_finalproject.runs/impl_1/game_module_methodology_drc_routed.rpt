LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[0]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[0]_C/CLR, s0/i_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[1]_C/CLR, s0/i_reg[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[2]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[2]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[2]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[2]_C/CLR, s0/i_reg[2]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[3]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[3]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#8 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell s0/i_reg[3]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s0/i_reg[3]_C/CLR, s0/i_reg[3]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
